GoldFire Redux
==============

Description
-----------
GoldFire was a demo created by Carson F. Ball (ABRAXAS of the programming group ΣNDVZTRÆ⅃ MµZ1K) in the mid to late 1990s (source files indicate most versions during 1995 and 1996 with a final release in 1998).  In the original version, fire came up from the bottom and was duplicated and inverted to drop down from the top as well.  In the space between the top and bottom fire, the credits were displayed in a customized font.

Differences from the original
-----------------------------
Not all of the commands of the original are supported yet.  Among those are:
- Printing ABRAXAS in the fire and having it burn out (A)
- Choosing a random palette (R)
- Dynamic conversion to greyscale (G)
- Changing only the words to grey (W)
- Changing only the fire to grey (F)
- Changing everything back to color (C)
- Changing the aspect ratio (H)

Among other differences are:
- The fire is currently only at the top
- There are no words on the screen
- The frames / second are displayed when the user quits instead of the credits
- This version is much slower since it is written in Python and OpenGL rather than x86 Assembler and direct hardware calls
- This version is released under a Creative Commons license (see the License section below)
